# ML-Model-Lifecycle---Deployment-Project

Every year, approximately 15 million students apply to a university to pursue higher education. Most students apply to multiple universities in the hopes of getting accepted by one of them. Therefore, in order to minimize the number of applications and optimize the university selection process, we have built a university admit predictor that predicts if a student is likely to be admitted or rejected by a university. Our objective is to deploy this supervised machine learning model, such that it can be accessed publicly.
Specifically, we will deploy the model using PAAS (Platform as a Service) architecture that tells users whether they are likely to be admitted or rejected by a university with profile information like the university of choice, competitive examination scores of the user, work experience of the user etc. Additionally, the model also has a recommender system that will recommend top universities based on userâ€™s profile where he/she is likely to be admitted.
